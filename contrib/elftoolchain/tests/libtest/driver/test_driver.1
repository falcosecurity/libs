.Sh NAME
.Nm test-driver
.Nd scaffolding for executing
.Xr test 3
based tests from the command-line
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm test-executable
.Op Fl c Ar artefact-archive-name
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl n Ar run-name
.Op Fl p Ar search-path-directory
.Op Fl R Ar runtime-base-directory
.Op Fl s Ar execution-style
.Op Fl t Ar test-selector
.Op Fl T Ar seconds
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides a
.Fn main
function that will execute the
.Xr test 3
based tests in an executable according to the options specified
on the command-line.
The
.Nm
library usually used in conjunction with code generated by the
.Xr make-test-scaffolding 1
utility.
.Pp
Test executables built using
.Nm
recognize the following command-line options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c Ar archive-name
If this option is specified, then the
.Nm
provided scaffolding will copy test outputs and other artefacts from
the test run to the archive named by argument
.Ar archive-name .
The format of the archive is specified by the path name suffix of the
archive name.
The supported output formats are those supported by
.Xr libarchive 3 .
.It Fl l
If this option is specified, then the
.Nm
utility will list the selected tests and exit.
.It Fl n Ar run-name
Use the specified test run name in status messages and to name
any files and directories created during the test run.
If this option is not specified, then the base name of the test
executable is used.
.It Fl p Ar search-path-directory
Add the argument
.Ar search-path-directory
to the list of directories searched for by
.Xr test 3
utility functions.
.It Fl R Ar runtime-base-directory
Set the runtime base directory to the directory specified by the
argument
.Ar runtime-base-directory .
Tests execute with their current directory set to a subdirectory
within this directory.
The path specified by argument
.Ar runtime-base-directory
must exist, and must name a directory.
.Pp
If this option is not specified, then the
.Ev TEST_TMPDIR
environment variable will be examined.
If set to a non-empty value, then its value will be used.
Otherwise, the value of the
.Ev TMPDIR
environment variable will be used, if non-empty.
If neither of the environment variables
.Ev TEST_TMPDIR
and
.Ev TMPDIR
contain a non-empty value, then the path
.Dq Pa /tmp
will be used.
.It Fl s Ar execution-style
Set the desired execution style to that specified by argument
.Ar execution-style .
Legal values for
.Ar execution-style
are:
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Li atf
Be compatible with
.Nx
.Xr atf 9 .
.It Li tap
Be compatible with TAP
.Pq Test Anything Protocol .
.It Li test
Be compatible with libtest (this test framework).
.El
The default is to use libtest semantics.
.It Fl t Ar test-selector
Select (or deselect) tests to execute according to the argument
.Ar test-selector .
.Pp
Test selectors are specified using the following syntax:
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Xo
.Op Li - Ns
.Li c : Ns Ar pattern
.Xc
Select test cases whose names match
.Ar pattern .
Selecting a test case will cause all of its contained
test functions to be selected.
.It Xo
.Op Li - Ns
.Li f : Ns Ar pattern
.Xc
Select test functions whose names match
.Ar pattern .
.It Xo
.Op Li - Ns
.Li t : Ns Ar pattern
.Xc
Select the test cases and test functions associated with
tags matching
.Ar pattern .
.It Xo
.Op Li - Ns
.Ar pattern
.Xc
If the
.Li c ,
.Li f
or
.Li t
qualifiers were not specified, then the pattern is matched
against the names of test cases.
.El
The
.Ar pattern
fields of test selectors use shell wildcard syntax, as implemented by
.Xr fnmatch 3 .
.Pp
If no test selectors are specified then all the tests present in
the test executable will be run.
Otherwise, the test selectors specified are processed in the
order specified on the command line.
.Pp
A test selector that does not start with a
.Dq Li -
will add the entries that it matches to the currently selected list
of tests.
A test selector that starts with a
.Dq Li -
will remove the entries that it matches from the currently selected list
of tests.
.Pp
If at least one test selector was specified, and if the result of
applying the specified test selectors was an empty list
of tests, then the
.Nm
library will exit with an error message.
.It Fl T Ar seconds
Set the timeout for individual tests to
.Ar seconds .
If a test function fails to return with the specified number of seconds
then it is treated as having failed.
The default is to wait indefinitely for the test function to complete.
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity level by 1.
The default verbosity level is 0.
.El
.Ss Link-time Pre-requisites
The
.Nm
library expects the following symbols to be present in the
test executable it is linked with:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Xo
.Vt struct test_case_descriptor
.Va test_cases Ns []
.Xc
An array of test cases descriptors.
Test case descriptors described by
.Xr test_case 5 .
.It Xo
.Vt int
.Va test_case_count
.Xc
The number of entries in the
.Va test_cases
array.
.El
.Ss Test Execution
At start up, the
.Fn main
function provided by
.Nm
will select tests (and test cases) to execute, based on the test
selection options specified.
.Pp
For each selected test case, test execution proceeds as follows:
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
The runtime directory for the test case is created.
.It
The test process forks, with test execution continuing in the
child.
.It
.Pq Child
The current directory of the process is changed to the runtime
directory.
.It
.Pq Child
The test case's set up function is then executed.
If this function returns an error then test case execution is
aborted.
.It
.Pq Child
Each selected test function in the test case is then executed and
its status is output to stdout (or stderr) according to the test
execution style selected.
.It
.Pq Child
The test case's tear down function is then executed.
.It
If test artefacts need to be preserved, then these are
copied to the specified archive.
.It
The test's runtime directory is then deleted.
.El
.Pp
After all test cases have been attempted, the
.Fn main
function exits with the exit code appropriate for the
test execution style selected.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To run all tests in the binary named
.Pa tc_example ,
copying test artefacts to a
.Xr cpio 1
archive named
.Pa /tmp/tc_example.cpio ,
use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tc_example -c /tmp/tc_example.cpio
.Ed
.Pp
To execute tests in the test case
.Dq tc1
alone, use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tc_example -t 'c:tc1'
.Ed
.Pp
To execute tests in the test case
.Dq tc1
but not the test functions associated with tag
.Li tag1 ,
use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tc_example -t 'c:tc1' -t '-t:tag1'
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Test programs built with the
.Nm
library will exit with an exit code of 0 if all of the selected tests
passed when run, and with a non-zero exit code if an error
occurred during test execution.
