# This shell script generates ic_count.c which contains a single
# variable definition `ic_count'. Variable `ic_count' is assigned
# the number of IC (invocable components) in the directory `dir'.
# The script count IC number by simply counting the number
# of .xml.gz files contained in the `dir', based on the fact that
# one .xml.gz file defines exactly one IC.
