.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates an ELF relocatable object from assembly language
sources.
.Pp
If multiple source files are specified,
.Nm
will read each of them in the order specified.
If no files are specified,
.Nm
will read from standard input.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility understands the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl D
Display internal debugging messages.
.It Fl I Ar dir
Add the directory named by argument
.Ar dir
to the search path used by the
.Ic ".include"
directive.
.It Fl J
Suppress warnings about overflows in signed arithmetic.
.It Fl K
Warn about alterations to difference tables if any.
.It Fl L | Fl -keep-locals
Keep local symbols in the output file.
The default is to discard local symbols.
.It Fl R
Merge the
.Li .data
and
.Li .text
sections when creating an object.
.It Fl V
Print the assembler version on standard output before assembling
the inputs.
.It Fl W | Fl -no-warn
Suppress assembler warnings.
.It Fl Z
Generate an output object even if there were errors in the input.
.It Fl a Ns Oo Ar cdghlns Oc Ns Oo Ar =filename Oc
Control generated listings.
The supported flags are:
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It c
Omit listing code in false conditional paths.
.It d
Omit debugging directives.
.It g
Include the version of the assembler and other general information
in the generated listing.
.It h
Include high-level source in the listing.
.It l
Include assembly source in the listing.
.It m
Include macro expansions in the listing.
.It n
Suppress generation of the header and footer in the listing.
.It s
Include symbol information in the listing.
.It = Ns Ar filename
Set the name of the listing file to that specified by argument
.Ar filename .
If specified, this flag must be the last in the list.
.El
If option
.Fl a
is specified without additional arguments, a flag set of
.Sq Ar hls
is assumed.
.It Fl g | Fl -gen-debug
Generate debug information in DWARF format.
.It Fl h | Fl -help
Show a help message and exit.
.It Fl march Ns = Ns Ar cpu Ns Oo ,+ Ns Oo Ar extensions Oc Ns "..." Oc
Generated code for the CPU named by argument
.Ar cpu
with additional instruction set extensions named by the argument
.Ar extensions .
.It Fl mtune Ns = Ns Ar cpu
Optimize the assembled object for the CPU named by the argument
.Ar cpu .
.It Fl n
Do not optimize code alignment.
.It Fl o Ar filename
Write the assembled output to the file named by argument
.Ar filename .
.It Fl q
Suppress warnings.
.It Fl -MD Ar filename
Write dependency information in a form usable by
.Xr make 1
to the file name by argument
.Ar filename .
.It Fl -defsym Ar symbol Ns = Ns Ar value
Define symbol named by the argument
.Ar symbol
as having the value named by
.Ar value .
The argument value is an integer in one of the forms accepted
by
.Xr atoi 3 .
.It Fl -fatal-warnings
Treat all warnings as fatal.
.It Fl -listing-lhs-width Ns = Ns Ar nwords
Set the width of the output data column in a listing to the number
of machine words specified in argument
.Ar nwords .
.It Fl -listing-lhs-width2 Ns = Ns Ar nwords
Set the width of continuation lines for the data column to the number
of machine words specified in argument
.Ar nwords .
.It Fl -listing-rhs-width Ns = Ns Ar nchars
Set the maximum displayed width of an input source line to the number
of characters specified by argument
.Ar nchars .
.It Fl -listing-cont-lines Ns = Ns Ar nlines
Set the maximum number of listing lines generated by one input source
line to
.Ar nlines Ns No + Ns 1 .
.It Fl -statistics
Print statistics for the run at exit.
.It Fl -strip-local-absolute
Remove local absolute symbols from the generated output.
.It Fl -target-help
Display help for the target CPU.
.It Fl -version
Print a version identifier and exit.
.It Fl -warn
Print warnings.
