# falcosecurity/libs

As per the [OSS Libraries Contribution Plan](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/proposals/2021019-libraries-donation.md), this repository has been chosen to be the new home for **libsinsp**, **libscap**, the **kernel module driver** and the **eBPF driver sources** which Sysdig Inc. has contributed to the Falco project.

Those libraries and drivers have been originally developed as part of the [draios/sysdig](https://github.com/draios/sysdig) repository.
