		# Why we mirror jq here?
		#
		# In their readme, jq claims that you don't have
		# to do autoreconf -fi when downloading a released tarball.
		#
		# However, they forgot to push the released makefiles
		# into their release tarbal.
		#
		# For this reason, we have to mirror their release after
		# doing the configuration ourselves.
		#
		# This is needed because many distros do not ship the right
		# version of autoreconf, making virtually impossible to build libs on them.
		# Read more about it here:
		#   https://github.com/stedolan/jq/issues/2061#issuecomment-593445920
