/*
 * Basic idea:
 * * when container_manager tries to resolve a threadinfo container, it will update
 * * its user/group informations, using following algorithm:
 * * if the thread itself is on the HOST, it will call getpwuid/getgrgid,
 * 		and store the new user/group together with informations,
 * 		eventually notifying any change in users and groups.
 * 		If no information can be retrieved, only uid/gid will be stored as informations, with "<NA>" for everything else.
 * * if the thread is on a container, the new user/group will be stored using the container id as key,
 * 		without additional info (ie: username, homedir etc etc will be left "<NA>")
 * 		because they cannot be retrieved from a container.
 * 		Then, a PPME_{USER,GROUP}_ADDED event is emitted, to allow capture files to rebuild the state.
 *
 * * on PPME_{USER,GROUP}_ADDED, the new user/group is stored in the m_{user,group}_list<container_id>, if not present.
 *
 * * Host users and groups lists are cleared once every DEFAULT_DELETED_USERS_GROUPS_SCAN_TIME_S (1 min by default),
 * 		see sinsp::m_deleted_users_groups_scan_time_ns.
 * 		Then, the users and groups will be refreshed as explained above, every time a threadinfo is created.
 * 		This is needed to fetch deleted users/groups, or overwritten ones.
 * 		Note: PPME_USER_DELETED_E is never sent for host users; we miss
 * 		the mechanism to undestand when an user is removed (without calling scap_get_userlist
 * 		and comparing to the already stored one; but that is an heavy operation).
 * * Containers users and groups gets bulk deleted once the container is cleaned up and
 *      PPME_{USER,GROUP}_DELETED_E event is sent for each of them.
 *
 * * Each threadinfo stores internally its user and group informations.
 *      This is needed to avoid that eg: a threadinfo spawns on uid 1000 "foo".
 *      Then, uid 1000 is deleted, and a new uid 1000 is created, named "bar".
 *      We need to be able to tell that the threadinfo user is still "foo".
