# Scap-file tests

In the folder `/<build-folder>/scap_files` there are all the scap-files used in these tests.
For each scap-file in this folder, we have a dedicated folder (called as the scap-file) which contains:

- the test file `.cpp`
- a `README.md` file with the description of tests and a pstree-like output.
